🖥️ Interactive Sales Performance Dashboard  

This project showcases a fully interactive sales analytics dashboard built in Power BI, connected to a MySQL relational database.
It demonstrates the full workflow of a data analyst – from SQL data preparation & analytics to visual storytelling in Power BI.

🗄 SQL Data Preparation
Before creating the dashboard, the dataset was prepared and analyzed in MySQL.

✅ Relational Schema → 3 tables (Customers, Products, Orders) with proper primary/foreign keys  
✅ Data Quality Checks → verified sample rows, categories, regions, referential integrity  
✅ Business Aggregations → total revenue by region, category insights, top customers  
✅ Time-Series Analysis → extracted monthly sales trends with DATE_FORMAT()  
✅ Advanced Reporting → joins, rankings, and revenue share calculations  

➡ Result: Clean, structured, business-ready data for Power BI


📊 Power BI Dashboard

Once the data was ready, it was connected directly from MySQL into Power BI for visualization.  

It provides clear insights into:  

* Total Revenue
