# SQL Portfolio – E-commerce Analytics

This project simulates a **data analyst workflow** on a sample **E-commerce database**.  
It contains 3 tables:
- **Customers** – customer information (CustomerID, Name, Region)
- **Products** – product catalog (ProductID, Category, Price)
- **Orders** – transactional data (OrderID, CustomerID, ProductID, Quantity, TotalAmount, OrderDate)

## What I wanted to achieve

I aimed to demonstrate a **progressive approach to SQL analytics**:
1. **Basic queries** – simple SELECT, GROUP BY on a single table
2. **Intermediate queries** – JOIN between 2 tables with aggregation
3. **Full Star Schema JOIN** – Orders + Customers + Products
4. **Intermediate analytics** – monthly trends, top customers, regional performance
5. **Advanced analytics** – window functions (RANK), percentage share, insights for business
